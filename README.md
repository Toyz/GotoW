GotoW
=====

A basic tool to scan JAR files for uses of the goto_w instruction. To use this, you need the Oracle Java JDK, and to have a path
environmental variable properly configured (open a command line and try to run javap. If it works, you're good)

Please *don't* use the jar file in this repo. The irony would be unbearable.
